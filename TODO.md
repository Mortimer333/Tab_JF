# TO DO

1. [DONE] Expand paste/cut functionality to allow pasting content outside of the editor (plain text).
2. [DONE] Add custom fonts
3. [DONE] Add Rendering
4. [DONE] Check how we handle focusout on the editor
5. [DONE] More customization and triggers
6. [DONE] Add code coloring
7. [DONE] Make coloring optional, and possible to add your own style sheet
8. Add ability to mark part of the editor as to be highlighted (like from line 10 to 20 highlight syntax but after that normal render)
9. Move debug tool to other project, improve it and implement back as 3rd party service
10. Server driven rendering (infinite loading), so we can open files of GB in size
11. Add Y rendering (for very long lines like min.js)
