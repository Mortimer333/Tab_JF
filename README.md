# TAB JF - v. Dev demo
Single Page Text Editor

### Limitations:
- For now works only with `Consolas` font until I will provide a way to measure letter size in custom font
- No options for setting customization to font - no bolding, no headers, no quotes
- No version control (_ctrl+z/ctrl+y_)
- etc.

Just a to replace `content-editable` until the new `API` will came out.

### Planned features (_in a order they will be implemented_):
  - version control
  - custom fonts
  - code coloring (_CSS for now_)
  - rendering - only show on page the used part +-80 lines (_performance driven_)
  - font stylization (_bold/italic/underline_) (_class/inline CSS_)
